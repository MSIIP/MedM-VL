No pleural effusion or increased thickness was detected. No mass appearance was observed in the precardiac fat pad. In the mediastinum, a few sequelae calcific lymph nodes, the largest of which is 9 mm in the pretracheal area, and hypodense hiluses can be distinguished, were primarily evaluated in favor of reactive lymph nodes.
